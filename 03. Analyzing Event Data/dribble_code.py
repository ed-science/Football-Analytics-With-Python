This Python module will help users to create a pitch
map for dribbles for each Barcelona player that played in the 
El Clasico of 2009 where the result ended in favour
of Barcelona(2:6).

Modules Used(4):
---------------
1. matplotlib -- the vizualization library.
2. json -- module to work with JSON files.
3. pandas -- module to work with dataframes.
4. FCPython -- module to create football pitch map

from FCPython import createPitch

## Note Statsbomb data uses yards for their pitch dimensions
pitch_length_X = 120
pitch_width_Y = 80

## calling the function to create a pitch map
## yards is the unit for measurement and
## gray will be the line color of the pitch map
(fig,ax) = createPitch(pitch_length_X, pitch_width_Y,'yards','gray')

## match id for our El Clasico
match_id = 69249
home_team = 'Real Madrid'
away_team = 'Barcelona'
player_name = 'Lionel Andr√©s Messi Cuccittini'

## this is the name of our event data file for
## our required El Clasico
file_name = f'{match_id}.json'

my_data = json.load(
    open(f'../Statsbomb/data/events/{file_name}', 'r', encoding='utf-8')
)

## get the nested structure into a dataframe 
## store the dataframe in a dictionary with the match id as key
df = json_normalize(my_data, sep='_').assign(match_id = file_name[:-5])

## making the list of all column names
column = list(df.columns)

## all the type names we have in our dataframe
all_type_name = list(df['type_name'].unique())

## creating dataframe for dribbles
dribble_df = df.loc[df['type_name'] == 'Dribble'].set_index('index')
dribble_df.dropna(inplace=True, axis=1)
dribble_df = dribble_df.loc[dribble_df['player_name'] == player_name, :]

## iterating through the dribble dataframe we created
for row_num, dribble in dribble_df.iterrows():
    x_loc = dribble['location'][0]
    y_loc = dribble['location'][1]

    if dribble['player_name'] == player_name:
        touch_circle = plt.Circle((pitch_length_X - x_loc, y_loc), radius=1.5, color='blue')

        if dribble['dribble_outcome_name'] == 'Incomplete':
            ## if incomplete dribble then fade out the circle
            touch_circle.set_alpha(0.3)

        ax.add_patch(touch_circle)

## placing text on the plot
plt.text(10, 82, f"{player_name}'s Dribbls vs Real Madrid", fontsize=12)
plt.text(80, 85, 'Darker Circles: Successful Dribbles', fontsize=12)
plt.text(80, 82, 'Faded Circles: Unsuccessful Dribbles', fontsize=12)

## setting figure and saving it
fig.set_size_inches(12, 8)
fig.savefig(f"{player_name}'s Dribbles vs Real Madrid")

## displaying the plot
plt.show()

This Python module will create a shot map for
the match between Real Madrid and Barcelona for 
the La Liga season 2008-09 which ended with the
result 2:6 in favour of Barcelona.

Then through the vizualization we will try to 
analyze the xG for each shot taken by the both 
team.

Modules Used(5):
---------------
1. matplotlib -- the vizualization library.
2. numpy -- the numerical computation library.
3. json -- module to work with JSON files.
4. pandas -- module to work with dataframes.
5. FCPython -- module to create football pitch map

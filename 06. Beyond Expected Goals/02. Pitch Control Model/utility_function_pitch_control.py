This Python module will contain all the required
function for making a pitch control model.

This code was contributed on Friend of Tracking by Laurie Shaw
and the pitch control model concepts are from William Spearman's
research paper 'Beyond Expected Goals'

I have made notes on same on my GitHub Repository, more further explanation 
of the model you can check it out.

    '''
    Function contains all the parameters and their default 
    values so that we can use it for our pitch control 
    model building.
    
    Argument:
    time_to_control -- int, it is the minimum time a used by the player to control the ball
                       represented as 10^time_to_control.
                       If any player has less than 10^time_to_control value we will see it as
                       an outlier and will ignore that player.
                       
    Returns:
    params: dict, parameters required to build the model.

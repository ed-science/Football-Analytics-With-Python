This Python module will contain all the required
function for making a pitch control model.

This code was contributed on Friend of Tracking by Laurie Shaw
and the pitch control model concepts are from William Spearman's
research paper 'Beyond Expected Goals'

I have made notes on same on my GitHub Repository, more further explanation 
of the model you can check it out.
